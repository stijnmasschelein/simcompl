Title: Run Simulations of Complementarity Tests
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Author: Stijn Masschelein

Description: The package simulates data and compares different tests for
  complementarities between two choices. The simulated data assumes a
  number of independent decion makers choosing x1 and x2 with outcome y. Only
  observations with the highest outcome y are retained in the data. Different
  tests for complementarity between x1 and x2 are implemented. The simulations
  report test statistics for each test on each dataset in one dataset.
